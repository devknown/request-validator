### Installing via Composer

If you already have composer:

Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) in a common location or in your project:

```sh
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Create the `composer.json` file as follows:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "progsmile/request-validator": "@dev"
    }
}
```

Run the Composer installer:

```sh
$ php composer.phar install
```
